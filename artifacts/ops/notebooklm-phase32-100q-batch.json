      "answer": "1) KR8TIV should use a deterministic Finite State Machine (FSM) as the orchestrator to dictate the flow, treating agents as ephemeral workers that wake up to execute specific tools. The hierarchy includes up to four allowable specialist agents (e.g., FRIDAY, JOCASTA, EDITH) to perform the work, with a dedicated reviewer agent (defaulting to ARSENAL) automatically injected for arena modes to evaluate the outputs.\n\n2) unknown. The sources do not contain data on dynamic orchestrator election mechanisms for handling unavailable models, as KR8TIV utilizes a deterministic state machine (backend Python code) rather than an LLM for orchestration. \n\n3) New inbox tasks should remain unassigned by default and automatically trigger a notification message to the designated Board Lead agent. The lead agent can then triage, assign, or plan next steps based on the task details, ensuring controlled distribution across multi-agent lanes without LLM-driven guesswork.\n\n4) unknown. The sources specify that tasks facing blocked dependencies or exceeding retry limits are automatically returned to the `inbox` (unassigned) for the Lead to re-triage, but they do not define specific signals for automatic reassignment directly from one worker agent to another.\n\n5) Identity drift is prevented by maintaining a checksum baseline row for each active agent in the `agent_persona_integrity` table. Task-specific tone adaptation is permitted by enforcing a strict persona file precedence where `SOUL.md > USER.md > IDENTITY.md > AGENTS.md` in the generated workspace contracts.\n\n6) Persona files must be governed by the strict precedence order of `SOUL.md > USER.md > IDENTITY.md > AGENTS.md`. For runtime prompt packs and overrides, the scope binding precedence should follow `global > domain > organization > user` (or tenant).\n\n7) \"Max reasoning by default\" should be implemented by setting the runtime configuration to `thinkingDefault=max`. To accommodate mixed model providers, this must be paired with a fallback behavior configured as `highest_or_model_default`.\n\n8) When a model lacks a high-reasoning mode, the fallback policy should resolve to `highest_or_model_default`. This allows the system to seamlessly use the model's highest available reasoning setting or its standard default without failing the operation.\n\n9) Skill installation requests should utilize an \"ask-first\" governance model that defaults the request to a `pending_owner_approval` status. Additionally, tier-based quota controls must act as an automated gate, rejecting installation requests that exceed configured ability or storage limits.\n\n10) unknown. While the sources mention using W3C Traceparent Correlation for cross-agent audit trails and generating `IrmEvent` records with decisions, they do not specify the exact mandatory audit fields required specifically for skill install, update, or remove events.\n\n11) Individual-agent (personal) deployments allow for balanced autonomy where external writes are ask-first, while team (enterprise) deployments enforce stricter ask-first gates for medium/high-risk actions with centralized org-level governance. Despite these differences, both share a single distribution contract and scale their control flow via policy rather than divergent code paths.\n\n12) unknown. The sources state that customized AI squads are generated through a conversation where the AI outputs a squad specification (roles, SOUL.md templates), but they do not detail the specific mandatory onboarding questions needed to reliably personalize an individual agent.\n\n13) NotebookLM should be made optional per task by explicitly defining the `task_mode` (e.g., `standard`, `notebook`, `arena`, or `arena_notebook`). The mission handler assesses this mode and will only execute NotebookLM synchronization or query gates if a notebook-enabled mode is actively selected, preventing state churn on non-notebook tasks.\n\n14) The decision policy relies on the explicit `task_mode` and task configuration payload: `notebook` or `arena_notebook` modes trigger NotebookLM integration, while `standard` or standard `arena` modes default to plain reasoning. Supermemory is selectively layered into arena tasks only when the `arena_config.supermemory_enabled=true` flag is present.\n\n15) The best cadence for owner-managed local backups is twice-weekly. The system should issue twice-weekly warning prompts to unconfirmed tenants providing destination confirmation options.\n\n16) unknown. The sources confirm that backup reminder workflows exist and provide confirmation options, but they do not provide the specific UX wording used to balance clear risk warnings with low-friction consent.\n\n17) Tier-based ability limits should be enforced by intercepting requests at the installation or execution phase and rejecting operations that exceed ability/storage limits with clear quota messages. This ensures out-of-bounds requests are halted (e.g., `pending_owner_approval`) gracefully rather than breaking or crashing the underlying automation runtime.\n\n18) The minimum telemetry needed for the deterministic evaluator includes task success, retry counts, latency regression, format compliance, and approval gate compliance. These inputs allow the control plane to score and verify synchronous execution quality without generating new model-call costs.\n\n19) Task execution should freeze and fail closed upon critical policy violations (e.g., forbidden path access, invalid policies, unauthorized security alterations caught by Clawdstrike guards). Execution should also halt and return the task to the inbox if fatal API errors occur (e.g., missing notebooks), retry limits are exceeded, or mandatory dependency/done-gate checks fail.\n\n20) unknown. The provided sources only document operations, architectures, and rollout phases up to Phase 18 (e.g., Phase 18 migration gate validation) and contain no data regarding Phase 32 priorities.",
      "prompt": "Answer ALL 20 questions below.\nFormat strictly as: 1) ... 2) ... up to 20).\nKeep each answer concise and implementation-focused (1-3 sentences).\nIf unknown, say 'unknown' and state what data is missing.\n\n1) What deterministic role hierarchy should KR8TIV use for team deployments (orchestrator, specialist agents, reviewer)?\n2) How should orchestrator election work when the preferred high-intelligence model is unavailable?\n3) What is the safest default routing policy for new inbox tasks across multi-agent lanes?\n4) What signals should trigger an automatic reassignment from one agent to another?\n5) How do we prevent identity drift while still allowing task-specific tone adaptation?\n6) What precedence order should govern persona files and runtime overrides?\n7) How should 'max reasoning by default' be implemented across mixed model providers?\n8) What fallback policy should apply when a model lacks high-reasoning mode?\n9) What approval gates should exist before installing new skills into production agents?\n10) What audit fields should be required for every skill install/update/remove event?\n11) How should individual-agent deployments differ from team deployments in control flow?\n12) What mandatory onboarding questions should personalize an individual agent reliably?\n13) How should NotebookLM be optional per task without causing mode churn?\n14) What decision policy should choose between NotebookLM, Supermemory, or plain reasoning per task?\n15) What weekly backup prompt cadence is best for owner-managed local backups?\n16) What UX wording best balances clear risk warning and low-friction backup consent?\n17) How should tier-based ability limits be enforced without breaking critical automations?\n18) What minimum telemetry is needed to prove synchronous execution quality across the team?\n19) What hard stop conditions should freeze task execution to avoid cascading failures?\n20) What Phase 32 priorities should be shipped first for mission-critical reliability?"

      "answer": "1) The most reliable contract involves an external \"agent-watchdog\" sidecar implementing a Dead Man's Switch that monitors the gateway container's health [1]. The watchdog should send signed POST requests to a webhook endpoint at regular intervals to verify the proactive reasoning loop hasn't failed [1].\n\n2. Unknown. The sources specify a general 30-60 minute heartbeat interval for checking proactive tasks [2, 3], but lack data on how these intervals should dynamically adjust for active versus idle lane queues.\n\n3. The most error-prone keys that require schema validation include `gateway.bind` to prevent silent fallbacks to 0.0.0.0 exposure, and `gateway.controlUi.dangerouslyDisableDeviceAuth` which bypasses device identity checks [4-6]. Keys like `tools.elevated.enabled` and webhook session overrides (`hooks.allowRequestSessionKey`) should also be strictly guarded by schemas [6, 7].\n\n4. The OpenClaw gateway process must strictly own the Telegram socket and its grammY long-polling runner [8]. To prevent 409 getUpdates conflicts in multi-tenant environments, each instance using the same bot token must be strictly isolated or switched to webhook mode rather than using concurrent polling [9, 10].\n\n5. The optimal strategy involves a zero-overhead Docker API monitoring daemon that checks for a 5-minute heartbeat drift [11, 12]. When a timeout occurs, the daemon should execute a two-phase recovery by securely restarting the stalled container via the Docker API, then sending a single compiled diagnostic payload to a webhook to avoid alert spam [13].\n\n6. Channel settings such as `dmPolicy`, `groupPolicy`, network bindings, and tool allowlists should be declared immutably via a `harness.yaml` template [14, 15]. To strictly prevent the agent runtime from modifying these parameters during execution, `configWrites: false` should be explicitly set for messaging channels [16].\n\n7. OpenClaw should handle provider rate limits using its Agent Runner's Model Resolver, which monitors API key usage limits [17]. When a rate limit is hit during a heartbeat cycle, the system should automatically apply a cooldown to the primary key and instantly switch to a configured backup model [17, 18].\n\n8. Unknown. The sources confirm that OpenClaw's Model Resolver and IronClaw's `FailoverProvider` support automatic cooldowns and multi-provider failover when a primary model degrades [17, 19], but they do not define a specific, universal failover order (e.g., exact sequence of providers).\n\n9. Forced heartbeat resyncs should be safely triggered using OpenClaw's webhook surface (`POST /hooks/agent`) directed at isolated session keys [20]. Including the `deliver: false` flag ensures the orchestration remains internal and doesn't trigger unwarranted messaging notifications to the user [20].\n\n10. A healthy lane is indicated by the active runtime writing a POSIX timestamp to a localized file (`HEARTBEAT.md`) or SQLite registry every 60 seconds [12]. If the container is running but the timestamp drifts beyond a five-minute threshold, the lane is experiencing a silent failure and is faking liveness [12].\n\n11. Channel-specific failures are isolated using OpenClaw's \"Lane Queue\" architecture, which assigns each session its own dedicated execution lane [21]. By enforcing serial execution within a lane and managing concurrent tasks via parallel lane routing, a stalled channel will only block its specific session without corrupting the global queue [21].\n\n12. Safe template rollouts should be managed declaratively via a `harness.yaml` compiler and validated using Golden-File testing to ensure prompt and configuration stability [14, 22, 23]. In production, the update protocol must include taking a `tar` snapshot of the workspace, running `openclaw doctor` for safe migrations, and performing an `openclaw security audit --deep` [24, 25].\n\n13. Unknown. The sources explain how the Control UI's `update.run` RPC handles Gateway updates and aborts if rebases fail [26], but they lack specific data on patching retry mechanisms for agents when the Gateway connection is flaky.\n\n14. To support deterministic incident replay, every heartbeat should be recorded line-by-line in a structured JSONL transcript file [27, 28]. This replayable log must capture the entire agentic loop, including triggering events, specific tool calls made, execution results, and state tracking stored in `memory/heartbeat-state.json` [27, 29].\n\n15. The most effective prompt clauses instruct the agent to \"Follow [the checklist] strictly,\" \"Do not infer or repeat old tasks from prior chats,\" and explicitly require it to \"reply HEARTBEAT_OK\" if no tasks need attention [30]. These clauses prevent the model from hallucinating tasks or getting stuck in repetitive loops based on previous session histories [30].\n\n16. Stale runtime sessions should be detected and pruned using the sandbox's automated container pruning strategy [31]. Administrators should configure `prune.idleHours` to automatically remove containers inactive for a set period (e.g., 24 hours) and use `prune.maxAgeDays` to definitively cap a session container's overall lifetime [31, 32].\n\n17. Remote computer-control tools (like `system.run`) must be strictly governed by requiring explicit node pairing with token authentication [33]. They should operate exclusively over a secure Tailnet, enforcing \"deny\" by default and treating node pairing as highly privileged operator access with strict execution allowlists [34, 35].\n\n18. During agent provisioning, Supermemory plugin checks should be enforced via the Harness Compiler using Golden-File verification [22, 23]. The build process must run Mock HTTP stubs (MSW) to verify that the agent is properly utilizing scoped API keys and tenant-specific `containerTags` for cryptographically isolated memory ingestion [23, 36].\n\n19. After every redeploy, an end-to-end smoke test (`onboard-docker.sh`) should execute within an ephemeral Docker environment [37, 38]. This test must verify that the harness compiles properly, the gateway and watchdog containers start successfully, and the internal healthcheck endpoint returns a 200 OK status over the internal bridge network [37, 38].\n\n20. Unknown. The provided sources outline general high-impact hardening tasks (like Docker isolation, Tailscale VPNs, and capability allowlists), but do not contain any references to or data about a \"Phase 32\" OpenClaw hardening roadmap.",

      "answer": "1) A 7-day disk-retention policy should be enforced for daily backup tarballs [1]. This is implemented via a script using the `find` command with `-mtime +7 -exec rm -rf {} \\;` to automatically prune directories older than 7 days [1].\n\n2) unknown. The sources do not contain data regarding the schedule or safeguards for automated docker prune operations.\n\n3) unknown. The sources lack data specifying which exact directories must trigger hard disk pressure alerts, though general overall disk capacity metrics are monitored [2].\n\n4) The best rollback approach is to use the \"golden images\" (e.g., `clawdbot-golden:2026.2.4`) to instantly restore a clean snapshot [3, 4]. You should stop and remove the broken containers, restore `clawdbot.json` and authentication profiles from the \"survival kit\" directory, and deploy the new image [5, 6].\n\n5) unknown. The provided text lacks data regarding the promotion process for immutable image tags from staging to production.\n\n6) The minimum hardening baseline mandates using Tailscale VPN for remote access instead of exposing public ports directly to the internet [7, 8]. It also requires using strong SSH keys or passwords and enforcing `chmod 600` permissions on API key files stored locally [9].\n\n7) unknown. The sources are missing data outlining protocols for SSH key lifecycle management and break-glass access.\n\n8) A secure firewall policy should be configured to only allow your specific IP address on the gateway port (e.g., port 18789) to prevent random internet traffic from reaching the bot [10, 11]. For maximum security, ports should not be exposed to the public internet at all, relying instead on private tunnels like Tailscale [7, 8].\n\n9) unknown. The documents contain no data regarding how database exposure controls should be continuously validated.\n\n10) unknown. The sources outline a restore procedure and daily backup scripts but lack data on a backup verification routine to prove restorable states [1, 6].\n\n11) unknown. The texts lack data explaining safe procedures for utilizing recovery mode when the root filesystem is saturated.\n\n12) unknown. The sources note a rollback runbook was scheduled to be documented by February 7th, but omit data defining specific runbook steps to execute before an incident response host reboot [12].\n\n13) unknown. The sources contain no data on how service startup ordering is strictly enforced following a host restart. \n\n14) unknown. The documents lack data specifying the required contents of default post-incident forensics evidence, though they do provide an example of a snapshot backup containing configs, docs, and network maps [13, 14].\n\n15) unknown. The sources are missing data on how the monitoring stack distinguishes between network outages and application outages.\n\n16) unknown. The sources propose alerting on 80% CPU/memory usage and throttling at 90% [4], but lack data defining specific thresholds that would trigger preemptive maintenance windows.\n\n17) unknown. The text contains no data regarding a formalized process for rotating secrets during emergency host interventions, only covering manual token refreshes for expired APIs [15, 16].\n\n18) unknown. The documents lack data specifying safe defaults for container log retention and rotation.\n\n19) unknown. The sources omit data defining a continuous compliance checklist for the VPS stack.\n\n20) unknown. The provided text contains no data or mentions regarding \"Phase 32\" infrastructure controls.",

      "answer": "1) Bot clashes (polling conflicts) are most commonly caused by multiple processes or bots attempting to use the same Telegram token simultaneously [1]. This frequently stems from configuration bugs, such as sub-components (e.g., a Buy Tracker) falling back to the main bot token, or duplicate token variables existing in environment files [2, 3].\n\n2) Unknown. The sources describe manual troubleshooting steps to ensure each bot has its own unique token (such as checking fallback chains and `.env` files), but they lack data regarding an automatic startup validation mechanism [1].\n\n3) A lock file mechanism best prevents concurrent pollers, ensuring only one process can poll per bot token [4]. If the lock is already held by a supervisor process, child processes should be configured to skip lock acquisition to avoid conflicts [5].\n\n4) Unknown. The sources do not contain information about a \"Mission Control\" system or its specific procedures for detecting and remediating duplicate runtime sessions.\n\n5) Automatic restarts should be governed by systemd policies using `StartLimitIntervalSec` and `StartLimitBurst` to prevent infinite restart crash loops on permanent failures, such as invalid tokens [3, 4]. Once a service exceeds the allowed burst limit within the specified interval, systemd will stop attempting automatic restarts, thereby requiring manual intervention [6].\n\n6) Cooldown windows should be tuned using directives like `RestartSec=30` to add a fixed delay between restart attempts [7, 8]. To fully prevent restart storms, this should be paired with `StartLimitIntervalSec=300` and `StartLimitBurst=5`, which tells the supervisor to stop trying if the unit fails 5 times within a 300-second window [3].\n\n7) Unknown. The sources specify checking standard application and kernel logs for \"InvalidToken\" or \"401 Unauthorized\" errors, but do not state which specific telemetry fields should capture clash signatures for rapid triage [9, 10].\n\n8) Unknown. While the sources mention using systemd CGroups for resource isolation and NATS JetStream for inter-agent messaging, they do not contain data explaining how worker queues specifically isolate one bot's faults from others [11, 12].\n\n9) Unknown. The sources mention monitoring API provider health states (HEALTHY, DEGRADED, FAILED) and logging system health via a dashboard, but they do not define the specific components required for a deterministic bot health score [13, 14].\n\n10) Unknown. The provided sources focus exclusively on Telegram and do not contain any data regarding WhatsApp or its failure paths.\n\n11) Unknown. The sources do not provide information on safeguards needed to prevent channel configuration regressions from old templates.\n\n12) Unknown. While the sources discuss using a LangGraph supervisor for orchestration and a circuit breaker pattern for API provider failovers, they lack data on how an orchestrator rebalances tasks when a bot repeatedly times out [12, 14].\n\n13) A bot should be validated through a progressive \"Trust Ladder\" system that requires it to complete a set number of successful, error-free actions to earn autonomy [15, 16]. These abilities are further validated during nightly reflection cycles that measure performance metrics, prediction accuracy, and user satisfaction before elevating permission levels [17, 18].\n\n14) Owner approval for high-risk changes should be captured through a human-in-the-loop workflow managed by the agent supervisor, or enforced via a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system [12, 19]. For highly sensitive operations, two-factor authentication (2FA) should also be captured before proceeding [20, 21].\n\n15) The best approach is to utilize a unified \"Portable Brain\" semantic memory system to guarantee cross-session context preservation [22, 23]. By continuously syncing learned patterns, conversation history, and voice principles to a persistent database, the bot prevents knowledge loss and maintains its tuned personality across restarts [23-25].\n\n16) Unknown. The sources detail intelligent model routing across different backends (like GPT-4 Turbo, Claude, and LLaMA) but do not contain data on how to enforce max-reasoning defaults [12, 26].\n\n17) Unknown. The provided sources lack data regarding fallback behaviors for notebook or memory dependency failures mid-task.\n\n18) Battle-tested configurations and context should be snapshotted using the `BrainExporter` tool to export the bot's state to a JSON file, which can then be safely reapplied using the `BrainImporter` [22]. On an infrastructure level, environment variable files should be timestamp-backed up prior to deployments, and VPS-level snapshots can be created to allow for safe restoration points [5, 27].\n\n19) Unknown. The sources list manual troubleshooting steps for resolving polling conflicts (such as verifying unique tokens and checking fallback chains) but lack a formal list of must-have regression checks to declare clash remediation complete [1, 28].\n\n20) Unknown. The sources do not contain any information regarding \"Phase 32\" or its associated bot-clash prevention tasks.",
